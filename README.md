# Rust Language Learning ðŸ¦€

My compilation of Rust learnings and topics from what I can understand, and also to keep a record on what i've learned in Rust through various sources. ðŸ¦€

I want to just focus on Rust and see what I can do with using the Rust Language. ðŸ¦€

And try to commit to Github atleast everyday no matter how small or ugly the code is still commit it until my Todo List is complete. ðŸ¦€
